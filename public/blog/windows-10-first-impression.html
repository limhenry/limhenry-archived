              <p>I reviewed Windows 10 few month ago and that is Windows 10 Technical Preview. Now, I am going to revisit this awesome OS.</p>
<p>Ok. Everyone is upgrading their operating system. Well, Windows released the “final version” of Windows few days ago, 29 July 2015: Windows 10. Of course, I also upgraded but I upgraded it right before launched (28 July 2015, 7 PM Malaysia Time). How? Don’t ask me but Google yourself. Anyway, you are eligible to get this awesome OS for free. Yeah, Microsoft will not charge will for a single cent. But remember one thing, you must using a genuine version of Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1. Now, let’s talk about my first impression for this Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are coming from Windows 7, and basically it’s a totally new OS and user-interface for you. Windows 8.1 user, it doesn’t have some much big changes. </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Bj7gKIR.png"><img alt="IMG" src="https://i.imgur.com/Bj7gKIRl.png" /></a></p>
<h3>Start Menu</h3>
<p>Basically, Microsoft combined the best features of Start Menu from Windows 7 and 8.1 . So it’s actually “half Windows 7” and “half Windows 8”. For Windows 8.1 user, “All Program” is back, but they called it “All apps” this time! And you still can get that card-like or metro design. In other word, the left part of Start Menu looks like Windows 7 while Windows 8.1 on the right hand side. Conclusion? Not bad.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Edge</h3>
<p>Before you ask me or Google it, yes, this is a browser. This is a replacement for Internet Explorer. Microsoft wants you to use their browser but not from Google or Mozilla. Microsoft Edge is much faster (yes, no kidding here) compare with Google Chrome (AKA the battery killer) and the design looks cleaner and nicer. Well, I set Microsoft Edge for my default browser so far. So what’s new in this browser? Microsoft wanted to make this browser more productive, so there introduced “Web Note”. Now you can take a note on a website or draw something on it and share to somewhere. Well, I don’t use this so much. What’s next? Reading mode. I read a lot of reviews and news, and this reading mode definitely make my online reading experience better. It makes a normal website to look cleaner, a better design for reading. And one more thing, Cortana (again, I will talk Cortana later on, but not here). Now, let’s talk about the ‘dark-side’ of Edge. It got a few disadvantages. First, buggy. Weird bug, and I dunno how to explain it, but it’s not a big deal, just ignore it. Second, it doesn’t support Service Worker completely. (Link: <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/</a>) But this Microsoft Edge really can replace your Firefox or Chrome. It’s awesome and fast.</p>
<h3>Cortana</h3>
<p>This is the thing make me want to upgrade to Windows 10 so much. I loved something like Google Now and Siri. It’s so smart. Now, finally it’s landed on Windows. Well, what is Cortana actually? Microsoft claimed this Cortana is the best intelligent personal assistant. Is this thing good? The answer is: it’s surprisingly nice. Cortana is a bit like Google Now, it showing you news, weather, reminder, your package, and much more. And the best thing for Cortana is “Hey Cortana”. It’s similar to Android’s “OK, Google”, and you can say (or scream, if you have a really bad microphone) Hey Cortana everywhere, you don’t need to run certain program before saying Hey Cortana. It works EVERYWHERE! So here are few questions I like to ask: “What is this song?”, “What is the weather right now?”, “Open Spotify”, “Turn off Wi-Fi” and something like that. One more thing, you also can ask Cortana to tell you a joke, just simply asking her “Hey Cortana, tell me a joke”. Although this Cortana might not working or listen wrongly, but it’s working most of the time. Ohya, you also can use Cortana right inside Microsoft Edge. When you are browsing something, then right click on the text, click on “Ask Cortana”. Bam! Magic happens. This Cortana is cool and awesome, well this is still my favorite feature in Windows 10.</p>

<h3>Virtual Desktop</h3>
<p>If you’re used Mac OS X before, you might familiar to this. This is very useful and also make you more productivity. Well, it’s a bit hard to explain this in text, look at the screenshot below and you should get what I mean. Anyway, if you are using a laptop, you should try to use touchpad (gesture) to change between those desktops (Yeah, it’s almost identical to Mac OS X). Or you can also use a keyboard to switch it (Windows Key + Ctrl + Left Arrow and Windows Key + Ctrl + Right Arrow). It’s quite handy for me. One thing, the animation while switching, that is nice (without dropping any frame)</p>

<h3>What Else</h3>
<p>Can I write other awesome features next time? Yeah, one last thing. Should you upgrade to Windows 10. Yes, definitely. A small tip here, if you upgrading from Windows 8.1/7, you will not lose any single file and software (yes, you don’t need to reinstall anything, cool right?), but make sure you choose “Keep files, settings, and applications”. That’s it. Want to get the latest stuff about Windows 10? Read from Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/</a></p>
<p>Now, give me some time to let me have more time to explore and find some hidden gems in this OS. I will talk to you guys next time. Thanks. Bye bye. </p>
