To get started, install the Chrome extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remote-for-google-slides/pojijacppbhikhkmegdoechbfiiibppi?utm=medium), open Google Slides in presentation mode, a six-digits PIN will show on the screen. Enter the PIN on [s.limhenry.xyz](http://s.limhenry.xyz/), and you are ready to go! \n\n ## Speaker Notes and Timer \n\n We introduced two new features in the latest update — speaker notes and timer. We added speaker notes, so you can refer to your notes during your presentation. To make sure you can keep track of time, we also added a timer on the bottom of the web application. We want you to have a successful presentation! \n\n ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*5Falt5uphgpMOx708XwnIQ.jpeg)*Remote for Google Slides works on everywhere — all you need is a browser* \n\n Remote for Slides is now available on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remote-for-google-slides/pojijacppbhikhkmegdoechbfiiibppi?utm=medium). We’d love to hear what you think. Please let us know how we can improve on Twitter ([@remoteforslides](https://twitter.com/remoteforslides)). \n\n Want to support this project?
