    "post": "![](https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/12/Remote-for-Google-Slides-796x398.jpg) \n\n Google Slides already lets you [beam your presentation deck to a Chromecast-equipped screen](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/11/run-presentations-from-your-phone-with-google-slides-for-android/) from your [iOS](https://thenextweb.com/topic/ios/) or [Android](https://thenextweb.com/topic/android/) device. Now, there’s another way to use your phone as a presentation remote, thanks to this handy browser extension created by Malaysia-based developer Henry Lim. \n\n Remote for Google Slides does what it says on the tin with Chrome or Opera – simply fire up your presentation and edit its URL, visit the link displayed on-screen (you can bookmark it for easy access) on your phone, enter the provided access code, and bam! Your handset is now a remote, with two large buttons to move back and forth between slides. \n\n The tool works like a charm, and also displays your speaker notes and a timer. The mobile site makes things go a bit easier by prompting you to add a shortcut to your home screen so you can easily get started the next time you’ve got a presentation to run. \n\n Grab the free extension [on this page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remote-for-google-slides/pojijacppbhikhkmegdoechbfiiibppi) to get started, and follow the on-screen instructions to begin controlling your presentations."
